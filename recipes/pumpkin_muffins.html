    </li>
    <li>The recipe uses a full can of pumpkin purée, so you don’t have to worry about figuring out what to do with leftover pumpkin. But, just in case you ever do find yourself with a little leftover pumpkin purée from other recipes we have 9 recipes to use it all up.

<u> <h2>Steps</h2> </u>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven and prepare the muffin tin:
        Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a standard muffin pan with muffin liners, or grease each well with butter.</li>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix the wet ingredients in a medium mixing bowl, add the pumpkin purée, brown sugar, eggs, and vegetable oil. Whisk until combined and homogenous.</li>
                <li>Pour the pumpkin mixture into the flour mixture. Stir with a large spoon or a rubber spatula just until combined and no streaks of flour remain. Do not overmix. It is okay if there are some lumps in the batter.</li>
                    <li>Divide the muffin batter evenly among the cups. Each well should be filled nearly to the top.</li>
                        <li>Bake muffins for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the muffin comes out clean.</li>
                        <li>Allow the muffins to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool for at least 10 minutes more. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>

                    </ol>
