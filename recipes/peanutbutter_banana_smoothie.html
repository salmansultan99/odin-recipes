    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole milk </li>
          <li>  1 medium ripe banana, cut into chunks and frozen </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons unsweetened peanut butter </li>
            <li>A few dashes cinnamon </li>
            <li> ice cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A smoothie with just three ingredients? Milk, peanut butter, and banana—where do I sign up? Well, four if you count the dash of cinnamon. Still, where do I sign up?
</p>
        <p>I recently scanned the menu of a popular smoothie shop in my neighborhood, marveling over some of the unusual ingredients: Brown rice protein, adaptogenic mushroom mix, cold-pressed turmeric juice, and something called Blue Magik. 
        </p>
       <p> I’m sure every single one is packed with promise, but sometimes a girl just wants what’s familiar (say a straight up Peanut Butter and Banana Smoothie this like one). It’s creamy, deliciously nutty, and just so simple. 
    </p>
        <p>The recipe is built on 3 little ingredients you likely have in your pantry right now. And if you don’t, you can march yourself to any supermarket or corner shop to get them. Milk, bananas, and peanut butter are the essentials. I also like to add a few dashes of cinnamon for good measure.</p>
    </p>

    <h2>Smoothie in a Snapshot</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Terrific creamy texture </li>
        <li>Good for you!
        </li>
        <li>Naturally sweet (no added sugar)
        </li>
        <li>Super flexible recipe 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Healthy Smoothie</h2>
    <p>If you didn’t know what went into this smoothie, you might think it’s more decadent and less nutritious than it is. That’s because it’s so darn creamy and peanut buttery. But good for you it is.</p>
    <p>Each serving delivers plenty of protein (particularly if you use cow’s milk or a protein-rich plant milk, such as soy or pea milk), calcium, potassium, fiber, and vitamin E. 
</p>
<p>The mash up of protein and healthy fats also makes it quite satisfying so you stay full longer.

</p>

<h2>Freeze Your Bananas First</h2>
<p>Making this smoothie with a frozen banana is key. The banana lends natural sweetness, and when frozen, does wonders for the texture. 

</p>

<p>Let your banana get good and ripe—mottled with black spots. Peel it, slice it and store in a resealable bag or covered container. Freeze overnight. When it’s smoothie time, add it to the blender. Bananas will keep well for several months in the freezer when properly sealed. 

</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>The recipe below is the basics of a creamy peanut butter banana smoothie, but feel free to make a few adjustments to make it your own. Here are a few suggestions:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>Add 1 cup whole milk, banana, peanut butter, cinnamon, and ice to a blender carafe. <li>Start the blender on low and gradually increase to high.</li> 

      <li>Stop and scrape down the sides of the blender as needed. If the smoothie is too thick add additional milk, one tablespoon at a time, to reach desired consistency.</li> 
        
        <li>Blend until the smoothie is frothy and smooth with ice completely blended. 
            <li> Serve. </li>
            
    
</ol>
